# Automated Integrated Molecular and Process Design Enabled by Bayesian Optimization

This repository contains the data and scripts involved in the manuscript:

**BayesCAMPD: Automated Integrated Molecular and Process Design Enabled by Bayesian Optimization**

## Requirements 
### Library (Python 3.10)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Gaussian processes
* [scipy](https://pymoo.org/): differential evolution 
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): visualization

### Software
* Aspen Plus: chemical process simulation

## Note
The process simulation involved in this work is largely supported by our automatic simulation tool, which can be found in "[**Automatic Process Simulation in Aspen Plus**](https://github.com/zwang1995/Aspen-Plus-Automation)".
